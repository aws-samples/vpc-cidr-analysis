# Analyze Network Traffic of Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) by CIDR blocks

Blog **[Analyze Network Traffic of Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) by CIDR blocks](setup/InstructionGuide.md)** shows how you can analyze traffic going in and out of your VPC from a particular CIDR block by using VPC Flow Logs, Athena, and Lambda. We also showed how you can identify the specific IP dependencies between peered private VPCs. Furthermore, we showed how you can analyze the unintentional routing in and out of the VPC over private IP addresses.
